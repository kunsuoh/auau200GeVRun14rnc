Hello, HF, 

We have made some changes in the repository structure, please read the whole mail!

1) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

We have moved the code to a new git-organization,

    https://github.com/rnc-lbl

Which holds two repositories:

* For the code (both StPicoD0AnaMaker and StPicoHFMaker)
        https://github.com/rnc-lbl/auau200GeVRun14

* For filelists (both picoDsts and D0 trees)
        https://github.com/rnc-lbl/fileLists
   - the fileList in the code repositories has been removed

UPDATE :
* Which URL should you use for git clone 
  - If you only want to use our code and are not interested on 
    developing work on the base classes, use 
       <GIT URL> = https://github.com/rnc-lbl

  - If you are (or would like to be) part of the devel team
    (You want to push some code back to github), use 
       <GIT URL> = git@github.com:rnc-lbl

If you have a    git clone     of from Mustafas auau200GeVRun14 repository {

        you need to update the “origin” via

        ../auau200GeVRun14$ git remote set-url origin <GIT URL>/auau200GeVRun14.git

        You can verify via:
        ../auau200GeVRun14$ git remote show origin
}
else If you have a     git fork     of from Mustafas auau200GeVRun14 repository {

        you need to update the “upstream” via

        ../auau200GeVRun14$ git remote set-url upstream <GIT URL>/auau200GeVRun14.git

        You can verify via:
        ../auau200GeVRun14$ git remote show upstream
}

2) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Get the git repositories

        cd /path/to/your/git-clones

        git clone <GIT URL>/fileLists.git
        git clone <GIT URL>/auau200GeVRun14.git

In order to keep up with new fileLists and fixes and improvements of the code,
regularly update BOTH repositories via git pull

        cd /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14
        git pull
        cd /path/to/your/git-clones/fileLists
        git pull

3) = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Pre produced D0 trees

        - If you are analyzing the pre-produced D0 trees, we have created
          now a tag with which the D0 trees have been written.
          You get it via git checkout

                cd /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14
                git pull
                git checkout tags/v1.0

        - To list all tags
                git tag -l

        - All previous instructions are still valid

General HF analysis maker

        - For analysis makers, inheriting from the base class StPicoHFMaker, we created an example maker
                - StPicoHFMyAnaMaker
          https://github.com/rnc-lbl/auau200GeVRun14/tree/master/StRoot/StPicoHFMyAnaMaker

        - We also fixed some bugs in the base classes

        - We added a submission script for pdsf
                - (see readme: https://github.com/rnc-lbl/auau200GeVRun14/tree/master/starSubmit)

        - Your work folder "/path/to/your/directory/“ should have soft links to
                run14AuAu200GeVPrescales -> /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/run14AuAu200GeVPrescales
                starSubmit -> /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/starSubmit
                StRoot -> /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/StRoot

                        cd /path/to/your/directory/
                        ln -s /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/StRoot
                        ln -s /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/starSubmit
                        ln -s /path/to/your/git-clones/auau200GeVRun14/run14AuAu200GeVPrescales

                picoLists -> /path/to/your/git-clone/fileLists/Run14/AuAu/200GeV/picoLists

                        ln -s  /path/to/your/git-clone/fileLists/Run14/AuAu/200GeV/physics2/picoLists

                copy the submission script to the work folder

                        cp  starSubmit/submitPicoHFMaker.csh .

        - Add you analysis code in path/to/your/directory/auau200GeVRun14/StRoot/StPicoHFMyAnaMaker
        - Add your cuts to the steering macro: /path/to/your/directory/auau200GeVRun14/StRoot/macros/runPicoHFMyAnaMaker.C
        - compile in your work directory - using the right star software version

                        cd /path/to/your/directory/
                        starver SL15c
                        cons

        - Submit (after local testing) and making changes to the script

                submitPicoHFMaker.csh

Let us know if you encounter an issue or bug/feature!
 - via email
 - or create an “issue” https://github.com/rnc-lbl/auau200GeVRun14/issues
